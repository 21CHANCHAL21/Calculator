# Calculator

I started a project a few weeks ago to make a simple calculator with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 🧮

The challenge was exciting, and I've used all these technologies to bring it to life. Here's a brief overview of the project:

📟 User-Friendly Interface: I designed an interactive interface that allows users to perform four fundamental operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The key to this task was to ensure a user-friendly experience.

🧾 Display Screen: The calculator features a display screen that shows both user inputs and the results of their calculations. Creating this screen was a fascinating part of the project.

📐 CSS Grid System: To ensure neat and precise button alignments, I leveraged the power of CSS grid systems. It not only made the calculator look visually appealing but also enhanced its functionality.

🎛️ JavaScript Magic: The real magic happened in JavaScript. I used event listeners to capture user input, and with the help of if-else statements, operators, and loops, I managed to handle user interactions and perform calculations. This part of the project required some skill but was attainable even with a basic knowledge of these technologies.
